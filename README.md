# README

My own Wine builds tailored for my own use; Proaudio (Wine-NSPA). I use Wine-tkg 
as a base; that way I avoid a bunch of maintenance burden and it's easier to 
carry my own patches, without managing Wine's code base itself.

Not listing features or env variables for now, as I'm in the middle of working
on patches and rebasing things.
